# -Walmart-Sales-Analysis-SQL
A  SQL project built to dig into Walmart’s sales data — uncovering real insights on customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends across branches and cities.

💬 Project Story:
This project was all about seeing what stories lie hidden inside retail data — and trust me, Walmart had a lot to tell.

I started with a rich transactional dataset: sales across different branches, product lines, customer types, tax values, unit prices, payment methods, timestamps, and more. At first glance? Just a bunch of numbers. But once I loaded everything into MySQL, cleaned it up, and started asking the right questions, patterns began to emerge — and they were fascinating.

Using only SQL, I wrote queries to answer questions a business would actually care about:

Which product line sells the most?

Which city brings in the highest revenue?

What’s the average purchase value by gender or customer type?

On which days does Walmart see the most traffic?

How does the time of day affect the number of transactions?

To make things more insightful, I did some feature engineering right inside SQL. From the raw date_time field, I extracted new features like:

🕓 Time of Day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

📆 Day of Week (Monday through Sunday)

🗓️ Month of Purchase

These extra layers helped me drill into not just what is happening, but when and how. For example, I noticed that weekends saw higher ratings, and most purchases happened in the evening — useful info if you’re managing staff or marketing offers.

What I loved about this project is how SQL alone — no fancy tools, no dashboards — was enough to pull meaningful business insights from raw data. With a few well-written queries, I could help any Walmart manager figure out what’s working, what’s not, and where to focus next.

This wasn’t just a syntax exercise — it was a real-world case of using SQL to bring clarity to business operations.
